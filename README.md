#mssql_dynamicSP

In this repository, the dynamic_query.sql file describes how to create a MS-SQL stored procedure using the CREATE PROC statement and using dynamic query.

It is nothing more than prepared SQL code that you save so you can reuse the code.
In addition to running this same query over and over again you also have the ability to pass parameters to the stored procedure.

I added another example API written in C#.
